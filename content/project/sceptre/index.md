Sceptre is a platform built for conducting AI/ML related experiments. On-fly OCR functionality with the option to choose Tesseract (Open source) Engine, ABBYY Engine, or Azure OCR. Ability to create multiple projects with different versions and tag documents on the platform itself for recognition and extraction purpose. The platform lets users choose different algorithms for document extraction and define business-specific heuristics. The platform can also run multiple consistency checks and rules specified by the business. Finally, the platform will list down the documents where some validation failed and requires additional review.
