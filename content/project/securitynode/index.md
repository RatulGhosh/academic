IoT based general purpose Security and Surveillance system for home, office, traffic etc. The application continuously records videos and if there is any motion a signal is sent to the Node Mcu which in turn triggers a buzzer. There is an extended application of integrating with the Dropbox API so that the system can automatically upload security photos to our personal Dropbox account.
