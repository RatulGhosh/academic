Semse is a search tool that extracts business knowledge trapped inside thousands of documents by mitigating users' struggle of finding information that they are looking for. Semse uses all documents in as-is, where-is basis. It automatically learns entire knowledge from all the documents using state of the art deep learning techniques. It is a language-independent search engine that lets users ask questions in any language. It reduces the manual efforts of preparing training data and organizing questions from users. It also uses iterative learning and continuously evolves based on usage.
