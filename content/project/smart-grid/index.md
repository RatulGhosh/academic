The objective of this project is to conserve electricity using IoT-based Smart Grid incorporating different sensors at the power station and houses. Manually determining the root cause of failures is often tedious for a complex system operating in large-scale distributed heterogeneous environments. The model is used to maximize the utility of the consumer, subject to a minimum daily energy consumption level, maximum and minimum hourly load levels, and ramping limits on such load levels. Monitoring the real-time data of the power consumption by the appliances connected to a network and if less than a certain value the re-routing of power to some other place which is in need takes place. A smart meter which delivers the real-time data consumption by the consumers. Fault in one grid leads to the re-routing of power through the nearest grid. A simple bidirectional communication between the power supplier and the consumer enables the implementation of the proposed model.
