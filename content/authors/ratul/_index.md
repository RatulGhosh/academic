I'm a data scientist at [Société Générale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en/home), working as part of ML CoE, Innovation team.
I work on developing business transforming product suite focused on automatic KYC remediation, extracting context-based information from scanned documents and multilingual chatbots using AI. Before that, I got my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication from Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad.

During my bachelors, I was fortunate to work with some amazing mentors in different research labs. I have worked with [Prof. Kuntal Ghosh](https://www.isical.ac.in/kuntal-ghosh) and [Prof. Sanjit Maitra](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjit-maitra/home?authuser=0) at the [Center for Soft Computing Research](https://www.isical.ac.in/~scc/) of Indian Statistical Institute. I have done my bachelor thesis at the [TCS Innovation Labs](https://www.tata.com/about-us/innovation) working with [Dr. Brojeshwar Bhowmick](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Eqf8NrEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Apart from my academic endeavours, I like playing video games, sketching, cooking, reading about economics and history.
